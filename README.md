# Data Structures and Algorithms
My personal reviewer for different Data Structure and Algorithm Concepts.
<br><br>
**Note:** 
- items listed are not complete, only the ones I was only able to study at the moment. Will continue to update.
- for more details, you may visit this site https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/, it listed a lot of data structures and algorithms together with it's time complexity + a link to Wikipedia for each item.

## Language Used
- Java

## Data Structures
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- LinkedList
- Tree

## Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort

## Time Complexity
- Data Structures

    | Data Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Delete |
    |      ---       |  ---   |  ---   |  ---   |  ---   |
    | Array          |  O(1)  |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |
    | Stack          |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |  O(1)  |
    | Queue          |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |  O(1)  |
    | LinkedList     |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |  O(1)  |
    | Tree           | O(log<sub>2</sub>n) | O(log<sub>2</sub>n) | O(log<sub>2</sub>n) | O(log<sub>2</sub>n)  |

## Tree

### Tree Traversal
- In-Order
- Pre-Order
- Post-Order

### Unbalanced vs Balanced Trees
- Unbalanced Tree
    - All of the weight of tree is on one side.
- Balanced
    - Example: AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, B-Trees, etc.
