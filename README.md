# Data Structures and Algorithms
My personal reviewer for different Data Structure and Algorithm Concepts.
<br><br>
**Note:** 
- items listed are not complete, only the ones I was only able to study at the moment. Will continue to update.
- for more details, you may visit this site https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/, it listed a lot of data structures and algorithms together with it's time complexity + a link to Wikipedia for each item.

## Language Used

## Data Structures
- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- LinkedList
- Tree

## Sorting Algorithms

## Time Complexity

- Data Structure

    | Data Structure | Access | Search | Insert | Delete |
    |      ---       |  ---   |  ---   |  ---   |  ---   |
    | Array          |  O(1)  |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |
    | Stack          |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |  O(1)  |
    | Queue          |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |  O(1)  |
    | LinkedList     |  O(n)  |  O(n)  |  O(1)  |  O(1)  |
    | Tree           | O(log<sub>2</sub>n) | O(log<sub>2</sub>n) | O(log<sub>2</sub>n) | O(log<sub>2</sub>n)  |

- Sorting Algorithm

    | Sorting Algorithm | Average Case        | Worst Case       |
    |      ---          |  ---                |  ---             |
    | Bubble Sort       |  O(n<sup>2</sup>)   | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
    | Selection Sort    |  O(n<sup>2</sup>)   | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
    | Insertion Sort    |  O(n<sup>2</sup>)   | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
    | Merge Sort        |  O(n log n)         | O(n log n)       |
    | Quick Sort        |  O(n log n)         | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
    | Shell Sort        |  O(n (log n)<sup>2</sup>) | O(n (log n)<sup>2</sup>) |
    | Counting Sort     |  O(n+k)             | O(n+k)         |
    | Radix Sort        |  O(nk)              | O(nk)            |
    | Bucket Sort       |  O(n+k)             | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |

## Tree

### Tree Traversal
- In-Order
- Pre-Order
- Post-Order

### Unbalanced vs Balanced Trees
- Unbalanced Tree
    - All of the weight of tree is on one side.
- Balanced
    - Example: AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, B-Trees, etc.
